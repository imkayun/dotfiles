This directory contains my Vim configuration (`.vimrc`). It is a minimal configuration as I only use Vim to make quick edits to text files during a terminal session.

- Tabs have a width of four spaces.

- Tabs are used for semantic indentation.

- Spaces are used for presentational indentation.

- All trailing whitespace is stripped on a file save.

- Re-mapped the leader key to the <kbd>SPACE</kbd> key.

- <kbd>SPACE</kbd> + <kbd>t</kbd> + <kbd>w</kbd> toggles the visibility of whitespace.

- <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> copies a selection in Vim to `~/.vimbuffer`.

- <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>p</kbd> pastes the selection from `~/.vimbuffer` to Vim.
